\begin{abstract}
Graphical User Interface or GUI have been used as main interface for computer user for daily usage. Without it, computer user these days will feel odd and restricted to spacific textual commands. However, hardware restrictions in embedded linux system is causing difficulties for this system to have a graphical user interface (GUI). These limitation have made embedded linux system unfriendly to user and can only be used by trained technicians.The use of textual command have been considered primitive and unfriendly to do the settings or configurations of the system. Therefore, Graphical User Interface can be developed to automate the configuration which is normally done using command line interface in embedded linux system. This graphical interface will allow user to do the settings by simple selections using mouse buttons instead of command line which normally have to be remembered and typed. User can also see the status of the system by a simple glance to graphical graphs and tables which will be more friendly. Since the embedded linux system doesnâ€™t have directly connected monitor, this interface will be developed using TCP/IP and HTTP protocols. It will be developed using PHP, Bash, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript Programming language.
