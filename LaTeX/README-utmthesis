        \include{pre/listofappendices} % include \listofappendices


Known Issues
=============
1. Sometimes, the Bibtex referencing takes the first instance from referencing
   figures in the ToC. This will result in the first reference number to be greater
   than [1] in Chapter 1.
        Solution: Before running Bibtex, comment \mainmatter and \preliminary{}.
		          Then run Bibtex and Latex. Then uncomment it and run Latex twice.

2. Itemize/enumerate/description indentation is off. This is a minor issue.
        Solution: Insert [leftmargin=1in] when using these commands.
              Eg: \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1in]
                  .....
                  .....
                  \end{itemize}

3. List of abbreviation does not arrange itself alphabetically. You must do this
   manually.
